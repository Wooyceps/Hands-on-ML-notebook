# Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow

This repository contains my work on the book "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" by Aurelien Geron. The book provides a practical approach to understanding machine learning algorithms and tools by working on real-world datasets and using Python libraries.

However, the book I have is in Polish, so the code and notes are in Polish too.

## Introduction

This project is a collection of Jupyter notebooks that contain my implementations and notes on the concepts, algorithms, and exercises presented in the book. The goal of this project is to provide a hands-on approach to learning machine learning, making it easier for others to understand and apply these concepts in their own projects.

## Installation

To run these notebooks, you need to have Python and the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install jupyter numpy pandas scikit-learn tensorflow keras matplotlib seaborn
```

## Usage

After installing the prerequisites, you can clone this repository and start Jupyter Notebook in the project directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Wooyceps/hands-on-ml.git
cd hands-on-ml
jupyter notebook
```

Then, you can open the notebooks you're interested in and run the cells.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or want to suggest a new feature, please open an issue. If you want to contribute code, please open a pull request. Make sure to update tests as appropriate.
